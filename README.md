I created "The Coding Laboratory" as a virtual laboratory to code my first website, inspired by <a href="https://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html"> Jennifer Dewalt</a>. I started with HTML, CSS and Javascript, and used Bootstrap to create responsive pages. My goal is to create three different projects each week and document my coding experiments on this site. 

Welcome to "The Coding Laboratory"!
